This video describes how to:
- connect a command handler to an STM32
- use the command line to display information about a FreeRTOS task
- use the shell to control motors.

The video uses the Cheburlyator debug board. I haven't filmed anything about it yet, but I might make a more detailed video describing it in the future.
